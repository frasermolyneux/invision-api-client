## .NET Support

This library targets .NET 9 and .NET 10 using multi-targeting. The NuGet package contains assemblies for both target frameworks.

### Build Requirements
- .NET 9 SDK
- .NET 10 SDK

### Dependency Management
Dependencies are maintained at versions compatible with both .NET 9 and .NET 10. Dependabot is configured to automatically update minor and patch versions only; major version updates require manual review.

### CI/CD
All GitHub workflows build and test against both .NET 9 and .NET 10 to ensure compatibility across both target frameworks.
